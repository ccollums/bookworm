					<h2>About</h2>
					<p className='app-summary'>BookWorm was created for those of us that hate searching through cluttered 
						sites or cluttered bookstores to find a notably good fiction novel. Make finding 
						your next read easy by only seeing the current NYT best sellers! And for all those goal 
						oriented readers (or want to be readers) to track their progress.

						<p className='bio'>Hi! I'm Carly, a front-end software engineering student at Turing school of software and 
						design. BookWorm was created as a final solo project to demonstarte my use of React, React Router, and Cypress.
						I consider myself to be a positive, and compassionate software developer driven by an imaginative thinking 
						style and growth mindset. The inspiration behind BookWorm greatly came from my love for reading and for minimalist design.
